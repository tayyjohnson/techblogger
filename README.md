# techblogger

TechBlogger is an application for users who want to share their thoughts with other devs about whatever is on their mind! TechBlogger is meant to be a "sharing platform" - a form of social media. it is geared more towards tech news. Things like maybe new software releases, how many cameras Apple is going to put on the back of their new phones, or how sad people who own Androids are! This app is an ORM project that utilizes Sequilize.
